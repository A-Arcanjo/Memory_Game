SPA modulo project

Backend Project - Goals for today:
Plan your project
What kind of project could you create with an interesting backend?
Idea: you could try to add a backend to the end-of-module project you did for the SPA module...
I recommend at least 1 hour of planning, as it will save you time later to have an idea, e.g., of what endpoints your server will need, and the design of your database (you could use an Entity Relationship Diagram - ERD - for this).
	
Start coding!
Remember, you will have approximately 3.5 days of coding time, with presentations in the afternoon of day 4.
You should aim to include in your project as many of the following as possible:
Frontend
A BASIC React frontend (the focus should be on building the backend!)
Backend
Backend routes + endpoints for various HTTP methods
Controllers
Middleware
Error handling middleware
A MongoDB database + collections
Mongoose methods
Mongoose models + schemas
Relations between collections
Data validation
bcrypt
Authentication with JWT
Authorization
Local Storage / Cookies
If feeling adventurous, you could also try to include multipart requests
multipart requests!
multipart requests let you send data of multiple types in a single request (e.g. a JSON object + an image file)
only look into this if this makes sense in the context of the project you are building!
Some research will be needed, e.g. https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/multipart-requests/
